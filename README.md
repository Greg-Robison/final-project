## final project
What this App is for:

As a fisherman I wanted a site that I could go to to keep track of my fishing trips.  I wanted a site that would track the weather and allow me to upload images and save information to those images.  I also wanted a map to show where I had caught fish. And because I am a fisherman I wanted to brag about the big fish that I had caught.
